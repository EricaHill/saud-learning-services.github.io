title: Canvas (Sauder) Semester Prep

summary: Generates a CSV that summarizes all Canvas courses that fall under a provided term id and account id(s).

---
Purpose: This script is used for getting a list of all courses and course related details in the UBC Sauder School of Business 454 sub-account. The script will check whether courses are associated with blueprints, and collect information such as Instructor, Course ID, Course Code, Number of enrolments, etc.   We use this information to create our Course Spreadsheet in Google.
Sauder Learning Services Operations staff will run this script.

### TODO: Learning Services Instructions for Use

1.	Once the Mass Course Creation is done from UBC IT, the sub account movement script will be run and courses will be moved into their correct subaccount. Following that, the semester prep script should be run.
2.	Log into Github and run the script according to the instructions
3.	Copy the Last terms Course Spreadsheet from the Learning Services Google Account. Rename the sheet for this term and share with the same people.
4.	Copy into Raw Data sheet in Google Sheets
5.	Copy over individual program courses into separate sheets on Google Spreadsheets
6.	Ensure all courses are listed in the right tabs and organized by course name by copying from Raw sheet into the correct program tab (e.g. BCOM, RHL, Dap)
7.	Once you have completed running the scripts, move the original spreadsheets to the 'Course Listing per Term' folder in the correct terms folder.  we do not want any old spreadsheets in the output folders or on your desktop. The location of theses folders are at: W:\Learning Services\Canvas\Canvas API\Operational Scripts\Semester Prep\Course listings per Term
